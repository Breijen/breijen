Hi, I'm Bryan.

🎶 **Music Enthusiast Turned Developer** 🎶

I'm a software developer with a unique journey that started in the world of music technology and has led me to the exciting realm of programming. After two years of working in marketing and IT, I decided to make a career switch to software development, driven by a passion for building things and solving complex problems.

For my projects, I usually dive deep into **Laravel**, **Next.js**, and **Rust**. My current passion project is developing my own Rust-based programming language called **Recolon**. I also have a background in music, and I play a variety of instruments including guitar, bass, drums, and piano.

🔧 **Tech Stack & Interests:**
- 🛠️ I'm currently working with **Rust**, **Next.js**, and **Laravel**.
- 🎸 I’m passionate about building creative software and also enjoy music composition.
- 📚 Always eager to learn more about **systems programming** and **language design**.

🎯 **Current Focus:**
- 🌱 Developing **Recolon**, a new programming language built on Rust.
- 🔄 Exploring the intersections between **music technology** and **software development**.
